    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>For the Chicken</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup Marsala wine (dry or sweet, as preferred)</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup cremini or white mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream (optional, for a richer sauce)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h4>Prepare the Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound them to an even thickness (about 1/2 inch thick) using a meat mallet or rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken in flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cook the Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Prepare the Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped shallot and cook until softened, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, cooking until the mushrooms are browned and any liquid has evaporated, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the Marsala wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Let it simmer for about 2 minutes to reduce slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to reduce and thicken.</li>
        <li>If using, stir in the heavy cream and let the sauce simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Combine and Serve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Return the chicken breasts to the skillet, spooning the sauce and mushrooms over the top.</li>
        <li>Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for 2-3 minutes, ensuring it is heated through and well-coated with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Serving</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Serve the Chicken Marsala hot, with the sauce spooned over the top.</li>
        <li>Pair it with mashed potatoes, pasta, or a side of vegetables.</li>
    </ol>
