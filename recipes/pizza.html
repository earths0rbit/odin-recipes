        <h1>Traditional Napoletana Pizza Recipe Using Biga</h1>
        <img src="./pizza-napoletana.png" alt="Pizza con biga" style="width: 500px; height:auto;">
        <p>The traditional Napoletana pizza made with biga features a light, airy crust with a slightly chewy texture and a crispy, golden-brown exterior. The biga, a pre-fermented dough, imparts a subtle depth of flavor and enhances the overall dough structure. The pizza is topped with a simple yet flavorful combination of San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil leaves, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. The result is a beautifully balanced pizza with a harmonious blend of fresh, high-quality ingredients and a deliciously authentic taste.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h4>Preparing the Biga</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve the fresh yeast in water.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour with the yeast-water mixture until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it ferment at room temperature for 16-24 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Preparing the Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve 3g of fresh yeast in 300g of water.</li>
            <li>Add the prepared biga to the water and mix until it breaks up and disperses in the water.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the 500g of "00" flour to the mixture, stirring until a dough begins to form.</li>
            <li>Add the salt and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 10-15 minutes by hand or 8-10 minutes with a stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal portions (about 250g each) and shape them into tight balls.</li>
            <li>Place the dough balls on a floured surface, cover with a damp cloth, and let them rise for 4-6 hours at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Preparing the Sauce</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Crush the canned San Marzano tomatoes by hand or with a blender until you get a smooth consistency.</li>
                <li>Add a pinch of sea salt to taste. No need to cook the sauce.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Assembling and Baking the Pizza</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible (250°C/482°F or higher if possible) and place a pizza stone or steel in the oven to heat up for at least 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>On a floured surface, take one dough ball and press it down with your fingers, gently stretching it into a 10-12 inch circle. Leave the edges slightly thicker for the crust.</li>
                <li>Transfer the stretched dough onto a floured pizza peel or parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving about an inch around the edges.</li>
                <li>Distribute the sliced mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add a few fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a small amount of extra virgin olive oil over the pizza.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Baking</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or steel in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly charred.</li>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Serving</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Drizzle a little more extra virgin olive oil on top of the pizza.</li>
                <li>Garnish with additional fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy your authentic Napoletana pizza!</li>
            </ol>
