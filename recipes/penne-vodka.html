    <p>Penne alla Vodka is a classic Italian-American pasta dish featuring penne pasta coated in a creamy, rich tomato-vodka sauce. The sauce is made with saut√©ed onions and garlic, simmered with vodka, and combined with crushed tomatoes and heavy cream for a luxurious texture. The dish is typically garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves, adding a burst of flavor and color. It's a comforting and indulgent meal that balances the tanginess of the tomatoes with the smoothness of the cream, making it a favorite for many pasta lovers.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>For the Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vodka</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes or tomato puree</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Pasta</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound penne pasta</li>
        <li>Salt for the pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h4>1. Prepare the Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour in the vodka and let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes, until it reduces by half.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes or tomato puree and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Allow the sauce to simmer for another 5-7 minutes, until it thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until it's fully melted and incorporated into the sauce. Keep the sauce warm on low heat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2. Cook the Pasta</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the penne pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>3. Combine and Serve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the cooked penne to the sauce, tossing to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to reach the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta and sauce together for 1-2 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Serve the Penne alla Vodka in bowls, garnished with chopped fresh basil and extra grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
